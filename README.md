# rock-paper-scissors (https://leungk712.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/)

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game tutorial from FreeCodeCamp. Added restart game button feature to eliminate need 
to press refresh button. 

This project was beneficial as it helped me understand how to continue to manipulate the DOM, write JavaScript using ES6 
terminology, and write functions that included switch statements, as I am used to if/else.
